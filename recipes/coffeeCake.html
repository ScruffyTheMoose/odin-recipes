    <h1>Coffee Cake</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My inspiration for this classic crumb coffee cake is the picture-perfect slices you find behind the glass at Starbucks—but bigger, better, and with more crumb!</p>
    <p>The cake batter includes sour cream, which not only adds richness but also helps maintain a tender crumb. There’s a cinnamon stripe through the center of the cake and a blanket of crumble over the top.</p>
    <p>To ensure that distinctive stripe, we layer about half of the batter into the bottom of the pan, sprinkle the cinnamon layer over the top, then the remaining batter, and finally, a thick cover of crumble topping.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Begin making the batter by mixing the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt in a large bowl. If you have a stand mixer, stir on low with a paddle attachment.</p>
            <p>Add the softened butter and beat on medium-low speed for 2 to 3 minutes or until the mixture resembled wet sand.</p>
